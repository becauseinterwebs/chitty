Arduino code for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Car

___

This code is intended for use with a prop Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car we produced for a high school play.  It has the following options:

- Front headlights (led)
- Neopixel strip around bottom of car for effects (ocean when "floating", blue with "flying")
- Simple RF remote (from Adafruit) to allow remote trigger of leds.

The ocean effects are provided by the Pacifica code released as an example with the FastLED library.

This code is incomplete as a better sky effect is needed (right now it's just a sky blue color but we want to add passing clouds simulation similar to the waves/whitecaps of the Pacifica code.)
